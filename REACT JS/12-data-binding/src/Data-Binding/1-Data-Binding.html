Data Binding :-

- Data binding is a technique of accessing data from source and displaying in UI, identifying the changes in data and updating back to source.

- JavaScript handles data binding using various DOM methods and Browser Events.
- React uses a data binding expression "{  }" that allows to bind data to any JSX element.

Syntax:
		var  uname = "John";

		<input type="text"  value={uname} />
		<p> Hello ! {uname} </p>

- You can bind any type of data to UI

- Data binding is classified into 2 types
    1) One Way Binding
    2) Two Way Binding
- Data Binding evolved from an architectural pattern called "MVC".
  [Model View Controller]
- Trygve introduced MVC architecture in early 1970's and formulated with "Small Talk".
- MVC allows code reusability and separation.
- It comprises of 3 components
    a) Model
    b) View
    c) Controller

Model
- Model represents the data you are working with.
- It comprises of logic that manipulates data.

View
- It represents the UI.
- It is responsible for presenting your data.

Controller
- It is the core component that handle overall process.
- It handles communication between model and controller.
- It defines application specific logic.

(1) One Way Binding:
- It is the process of accessign data from model and updating to UI.
- React implicitly supports one-way binding.
- It is faster in rendering UI, as it is un-directional.
- It is safe for data, as it will not allow any modification in data dynamically.

(2) Two Way Binding:-
- It is a data binding technique with bi-directional flow.
- You can access the data from Model and update to UI.
- You can identify the changes the UI and update back to Model.
- Model is considered as "Single-Source-of-Truth".

         previousValue == currentValue  => No change detected
         previousVlaue !== currentValue => Change detected

  Model comprises of data tracking before and after change. As it tracks the changes, it comprises of "Truth" that confirm change and updated.

- React will not support "Two-Way" data binding implicitly.
- You have to implement explicitly using event binding technique.
 - React two way binding can be handled only by using "onChange" event.

Syntax:
      function handleNameChange()
      {
      }

      <input type="text"  onChange={handNameChange}  />

- React uses in-built event listener, which can access element and event details using "event" argument.

     function handleNameChange(event)
     {
         event.clientX, clientY, keyCode, charCode, which etc..
         event.target.id, name, value, src, width, height etc..
    }
