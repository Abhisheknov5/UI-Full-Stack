Data Binding in React :-

- Data binding is a technique of accessing data from source and displaying in UI, identifying the changes in data and updating back to source.

- JavaScript handles data binding using various DOM methods and Browser Events.
- React uses a data binding expression "{  }" that allows to bind data to any JSX element.

Syntax:
		var  uname = "John";

		<input type="text"  value={uname} />
		<p> Hello ! {uname} </p>

- You can bind any type of data to UI
