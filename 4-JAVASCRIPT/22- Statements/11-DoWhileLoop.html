Loops, Iterations, Exceptions and Functions

The Do While Loop:
- It is a looping control statement used by developers, when they are not sure about the number of iterations and iteration counter may change dynamically.

- It ensures that statements will execute at least once even when the condition is not satisfied.

Syntax:
        intialization;
        do
        {
          statements;
          counter;
        } while(condition)
-->
<script>
    var i = 1;
    do
    {
        document.write(i+"<br>");
        i++;
    } while(i<=10);
</script>
