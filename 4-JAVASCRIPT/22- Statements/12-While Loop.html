<!--
The While Loop:
- It is similar to do-while but statements are executed only when the condition evalutes to true.

Syntax:
    initialization;
    while(condition)
    {
      statements;
      counter;
    }

<script>
    var i = 1;
    while(i<=10)
    {
        document.write(i + "<br>");
        i++;
    }
