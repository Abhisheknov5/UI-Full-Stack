Iterator Statements :-
- Iterator is a software design pattern, which is used to access elements from a collection in sequential order.
- It doesn't require initialization, condition and counter.
- Iterator uses a function generator, which allows to read and return a collection.
- Generator is a function that comprises of
        a) next()        => for counter
        b) done        => for condition
        c) value        => for reading values from collection
- JavaScript explicit iterators are

        for..in        => reads and returns all properties
        for..of        => reads and returns all values

Syntax:
    for (var property in collection)
    {
    }
   
    for (var value of collection)
    {
    }

<script>
    var categories = ["All","Electronics","Footwear","Fashion"];
    for(var item of categories)
    {
        document.write(item +"<br>");
    }
</script>

        yield "All";
        yield "Electronics";
        yield "Footwear";
    }
    var elements = ReadElements();
    console.log(elements.next());
