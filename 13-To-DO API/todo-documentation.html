Note:
 - API requires following libraries for handling data from client
        a) Body Parser
        b) CORS
- Body Parser is responsible for translating the "form" data into JSON, so that it can be posted to database.
- CORS [Cross Origin Resource Sharing] is required to configure request methods for data manipulations. You enable or disable various request from client using CORS.

        > npm  i  express  mongodb  cors  --save
