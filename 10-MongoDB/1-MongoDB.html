Creating a new Database: [MongoSh]

        > use  databaseName

 - If database name is a new name, then it creates the database.
 - If it is an existing name, then it changes into the database.

View existing databases:

        > show dbs
 
 - It can't display a database if it is empty.
 - To display database in list, you must have atleast one collection [table]

Adding a new collection:

        > db.createCollection("name", { options })
        > db.createCollection("name")
        > show collections                [to view all collections in database]
