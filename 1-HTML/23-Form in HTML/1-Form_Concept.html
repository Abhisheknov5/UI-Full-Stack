5. action    :  It defines the target page where data is submitted. It is usually a server side
           page. It is often required when submitting data to server.

6. novalidate : It is used to disable the default HTML validations.
            Every validation of HTML is not according to various client requirements,
            hence we have to disable default validation and define custom validation.

FAQ: Can we define nested forms in page?
        <form>

               child
            </form>

Ans:  No. You can design pseudo nested forms using AJAX.


                        Form Elements
                        --------------------
- Form comprises of various types of elements like buttons, textbox, checkbox, radio, listbox, dropdown etc.
- HTML provides different types of tokens for creating form elements, like
        <input>
        <select>
        <option>
        <optgroup>
        <textarea>
        <meter>
        <progress> etc..

Note: <input> is an HTML form element that allows to input various types of values.
      HTML 5 introduced several new data types to restrict input.

                             Text Box
- It is an input element used to manage string.
- String is a literal with group of characters. [alpha numeric and special chars]
- It allows user to view, edit and input value.
- The attribute "type" is used to change the input type.

Syntax:
    <input type="text">            => string input

Attributes:
1. Id                ]
2. name            ]   used to refer textbox in css and javascript
3. class            ]

Note: Every element in form must have "name" attribute.
      If name is not defined for any element in form, then the value of element is not
      submitted to server.

4. value            : It defines the default value to display in textbox.

Syntax:
    <input type="text" name="UserName"  value="John">

5. readonly        : It will not allow to modify the value in textbox.
                  It will not allow to input a value if textbox is empty.
                  It can submit the value.

Syntax:
    <input type="text"  name="UserName"  value="John" readonly>
    <input name="UserName" readonly  value="David"  type="text">


6. disabled        : It will not allows to modify and submit a value.

Syntax:
    <input type="text" name="UserName"  value="John" disabled>


7. placeholder        : It defines the watermark text to display in textbox before any value
                  is entered.

Syntax:
    <input type="text"  name="Mobile"  placeholder="eg: +91 and 10 digits">

8. autofocus        : It sets focus to element automatically on page load.

Syntax:
    <input type="text"  name="Mobile" autofocus>

9. size            :  It defines the width of textbox. It is not limit.

Syntax:
    <input type="text"  name="OTP"  size="4">

    <input type="text" name="OTP" size="4" maxlength="4">

11. minlength        : It sets validation for minimum number of characters.

Syntax:
    <input type="text" name="OTP" minlength="2" maxlength="4">

12. required        : It will not allow to submit empty. It is used for mandatory fields.

Syntax:
    <input type="text"  name="OTP" required minlength="4" maxlength="4">

Note: If input element is defined with multiple validations, then the first priority is for "required".

13. list            : It is used to attach a data list to input element.
                  The data list is a form element used for auto complete text.
                  Form data list is configured with
                    <datalist>
                    <option>
Syntax:
    <input type="text"  name="search"  list="terms" size="40">
    <datalist id="terms">
      <option> Term-1 </option>
      <option> Term-2 </option>
    </datalist>

Radio Buttons:-

- Radio button allows to select one or multiple options from a group of choices.
- Radio will not allow to uncheck any option after checked.
- Hence radios are used with "Mutex" mechanism.
- Mutex is Mutual Exclusion. It is a concept of multi threading.
- You can configure mutex for radios by specifiying common reference name.
- All radios in a category must have same name.

Syntax:
    <input type="radio"  name="gender"> Male
    <input type="radio"  name="gender"> Female

- If radios are configured with mutex then they allow user to select any one option from a group of choices.

- You can make any radio selected by default by using "checked" attribute.

    <input type="radio" name="gender"  checked>  Male

- If selection is mandatory and user can switch the selection then better configure with "radios".

- Every radio submits "on" as default value, hence we have to configure "value" attribute for radios.

- Radio doesn't have text, we have to configure using <label> element.

Syntax:
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="Male"> <label for="gender"> Male </label>

Check Box :-
- It is similar to radio button, but enables the user to check and uncheck any option dynamically.

Syntax:
 <input type="checkbox"  name="course"  value="WebUI" checked> <label for="course"> Web UI </label>

FAQ: How to design a check box list?
Ans:  HTML doesn't provide any checkbox list element.
     You have to design using CSS overflow attributes.

Dropdown:- 
- It allows user to select any one option from a group of choices.
- It can drop a list and allow to select item from list.
- It is designed by using following elements

    <select>                It configures dropdown
    <optgroup>            It configures a category in dropdown with label
    <option>                It configures an item in dropdown

Syntax:
    <select>
        <optgroup label="categoryName">
             <option> Item 1 </option>        
             <option> Item 2 </option>
        </optgroup>
    </select>

- Every option comprises following attributes

    a) value            : It defines the value to submit
    b) selected        : It selects the option automatically on page load.
    c) disabled        : It will not allow to select the option.

    <option  value="delhi"  selected>
    <option  value="delhi"  disabled>

ListBox:-
- A dropdown can transform into list box by using the attributes
    a) multiple
    b) size

Syntax:
    <select multiple size="4">

    </select>

- List box allows user to select multiple options. [enable multiple attribute]

Ex:
    <select name="City" size="3" multiple>
            <option>Delhi</option>
            <option>Hyd</option>
            <option>Mumbai</option>
        </select>

Note: Dropdown and Listbox options are RC data type. You can present only plain
      text content.

      <select>
            <option>Language</option>
            <option>English</option>
            <option>हिंदी</option>
        </select>

     - You can configure effects using style attributes.
     - A dropdown can't be nested.

    <meter min="1" max="100" value="100" low="20" high="80"> Yellow

        <div>
        <input type="text" name="UserName">

Buttons:-
- A button is used to confirm user action.
- HTML provides 2 types of buttons
    1. Generic Buttons
    2. Non Generic Buttons

- Generic buttons have pre-defined functionality, HTML generic buttons are
