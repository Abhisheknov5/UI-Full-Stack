        Books are man s best friends. Books are portable and so they are easy to carry around. And so books can be read at any time night or day, while travelling on a bus or train or flight, and at meal time too. Books are published in many languages and in varied genres. There are books in fiction and non-fiction categories. Each of these categories has many different sections and genres, and there are many thousands of titles in each type.
