State Management :-

- HTTP is a state less protocol.
- It follows the mechanism "Go-Get-Forget".

    Go            - Establish connection with server
    Get            - Get response from server
    Forget        - Cleanup the request and response details from server

- State less nature of Http is good for application, as it can manage its memory without overload.
- State less approach is not good for contineous operations, as it can't remember information between requests.
- Web applications implement various state management techniques to remember information between requests.
- State can be managed
        a) Server Side
        b) Client Side
- Server Side state management technique allocates memory on server to save the client data.
- Client side state management allocates memory on client device to save the data.
- JavaScript manages the state client side.
- JavaScript client state includes
        a) Local Storage
        b) Session Storage
        c) Cookie Storage
        d) Query String
