<!--
Local Storage :-
- It is a permanent storage.
- Browser maintains local storage, which keeps data and provides access across pages.
- It is available to use across tabs in browser.
- It will not remove the data implicitly.
- It is available until it is manually removed from memory.

        localStorage.setItem("key", value);
        localStorage.getItem("key");
        localStorage.removeItem("key");
   
- You can verify the availability of key in local storage by using "null". If key is not available it return "null".
