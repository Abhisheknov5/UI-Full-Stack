Styles

- Styles are additional attributes defined for HTML elements to make them more interactive and responsive.

- Styles are defined for HTML elements in 3 ways

    a) Inline Styles
    b) Embedded Styles
    c) External Style Sheets [CSS]


                             Inline Styles
- Inline is a technique where styles are defined for every element individually by using "style" attribute.

    <h1  style="attribute:value; attribute:value;...">  </h1>

- Inline styles are faster in rendering.
- However you can't reuse the styles.

Ex:
    <h1  style="background-color:yellow; color:red; text-align:center">

         HTML

    </h1>
