 Embedded Styles :-

- Styles are defined for elements using a <style> container.
- You can embed the style container in <head> or <body>.
- You can reuse the styles for various elements in page.
- However they are slow in rendering when compared to inline styles.
- You can't reuse across pages.

Syntax:
    <head>
        <style>
           selector
           {
            attribute: value;
            attribute: value;
           }
        </style>
    </head>

FAQ's:
1. Where to embed the <style> container? Head or Body?
A. You can embed in both <head> and <body> sections.
     Styles in <head> are intended to load into memory and accessed later when ever required.
     Styles in <body> are intended to load at the time of loading page.

2. If we define same attribute for element in both head and body which set of effects will apply?
A.
    If different attributes are configured in head and body then all will apply.
    If same attributes are defined then the recent is applied.


Note: Styles can be defined outside HTML scope, so that they can render faster.
      Howevery it is not a recommended practice for development.
