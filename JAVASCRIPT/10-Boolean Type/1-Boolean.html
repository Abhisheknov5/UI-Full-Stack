<!--
 Boolean Type:-
- Boolean is used in decision making.
- JavaScript boolean value can be true or false.
- JavaScript can handle boolean using 0 or 1 for comparision.
       
        0 = false
        1 = true

- Decision making is used to control the execution flow in a computer program.

Note: You can handle decision making with numeric value 0 or 1, but it is always recommended to use "true" or "false" keywords.

Syntax:
    var stock = true;
   
    if(stock==1)        => not good
    if(stock==true)        => good
    if(stock=="true")    => invalid

- To handle decision making JavaScript provides various operators

    1. Comparision Operators

        ==        Equal
        ===        Identical Equal
        !=        Not Equal
        !==        Not Identical
        <        less than
        <=        less than or equal
        >        greater than
        >=        greater than or equal

    2. Logical Operators

        &&        AND
        ||        OR
        !        NOT

FAQ: What is difference between "=="  &&  "===" ?
Ans:  "==" can compare values of 2 different data types.
           
            "10" == 10    => true

     "===" can compare only the values of same data type.

            "10" === 10    => false
            10 === 10    => true
           
FAQ: What is purpose of Local operators?
Ans:    They are used to build a statement with multiple conditions.

        condition1 && condition2  &&  condition3 => true if all 3 are true
        condition1 ||  condition2  || condition3  => true if any one is true

        They are also used in configuring negation of given expression.
       
         !true        => false
         !false        => true
<script>
    var x;
    if(x !== undefined){
        document.write(x);
    }
   
</script>

3. Ternary Operator:-

(condition) ? statement_on_true :  statement_on_false

FAQ: Can you name the element attributes which are boolen type?
Ans:      readonly, disabled, required, checked etc..

      <input type="text"  required>         required=true
      <input type="text"  disabled>      disabled=true
      <input type="checkbox" checked>  checked = true

-->
<script>
    var stock = 1;
    if(stock == true)  
    {
        document.write("Available");
    } else {
        document.write("Out od Stock");  
    }

</script>
