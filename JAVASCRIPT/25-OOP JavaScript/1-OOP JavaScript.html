JavaScript OOP:-

- Real world application development uses various programming techniques like

    a) POPS
    b) OBPS
    c) OOPS

POPS
- Process Oriented Programming System
- It supports low level features.
- It can directly interact with hardware services.
- It uses less memory.
- It is faster in interactions.

Ex: C, Pascal
- It doesn't support dynamic memory
- It is hard to reuse and extend
- It have separation issues

OBPS
- Object Base Programming System
- It enables dynamic memory
- It supports reusability
- It supports code separation
- It supports extensibility

Ex: JavaScript, Visual Basic
- No dynamic polymorphism
- No code level security
- Extensibility issues


OOPS
- Object Oriented Programming System
- Code reusability
- Code separation
- Dynamic Polymorphism
- Code level security
- Code Abstraction

Ex: C++, Java, C#

- They will not support low level features
- They can't directly interact with hardware services
- They require more memory
- They slow in interactions
- They are heavy on application.


Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language. It supports only few features of OOP.

Evolution OOP:
- "Alan Kay" introduced the concept of Object into computer programming.
- Object is used to keep all related data and logic together.
- In early 1967, Johan Olay & Kristian Nygaard introduced the concept of OOP with a language called "SIMULA".
- It enables code reusability.
- In early 1970's Trygve introduced code separation
- Trygve introduced MVC [Model View Controller]. => Small Talk Language

        Java        Spring MVC
        Python    Django, Flask, Grock
        PHP        Cake PHP, Code Igniter
        Ruby    Ruby on Rails
        .NET    ASP.NET MVC
        JavaScript  SPINE
- In early 1970's  C++
- In early 1990's  Java
- In early 2000  C#

                        JavaScript OOP Features

Modules
- A module comprises of data and logic.
- JavaScript module comprises of variables, functions and classes.
- It allows resuability and separation.
- JavaScript module system requires a special compiling technique, which is supported of module systems like
        a) Common JS
        b) Require JS
        c) UMD  (Universal Module Distribution)
        d) AMD (Asynchronous Module Distribution)
        e) ES Module etc..
