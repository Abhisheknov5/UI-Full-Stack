Constructor:-

- A constructor is responsible for instantiation, that is creating an object for class.
- It is a design pattern, which is a part of "Creational Patterns".
- "Creational Patterns" are software design patterns used in software development.
- Every class have a constructor configured implicitly, which is known as "Default Constructor".
- Constructor is a special type of sub-routine that executes automatically for every object.  [sub-routine = method]
- JavaScript constructor is "anonymous" type with "constructor" keyword.
- It executes only once per object.
- JavaScript class can have only one explicit constructor.

Syntax:
    class  Name
    {
       constructor()
       {
       }
    }

- Constructor can be parameterized or parameter less.
- It supports rest and spread.
