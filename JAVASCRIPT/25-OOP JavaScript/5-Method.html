   Method
- A method defines actions to be performed by object.
- Class can store all actions using method.
- In traditional programming
        function        => always returns
        method        => always void
        procedure    => changes from void to return & vice versa

- You can't define function as class member, but it can be inside class.
- Class allows methods as members.
- JavaScript class method have the behaviour of both method and function.

Syntax:
    class Name
    {
        Method1(params)
        {
        }
        Method2()
        {
        return value;
        }
        }
