<!--
Reusability & Extensibility
                    ------------------------------------
- Reusability allows to access members of existing class in a new class.
- Extensibility allows to extend the functionality of existing class without making changes in the class.
- You can implement reusability & extensibility using 2 techniques

        a) Aggregation
        b) Inheritance
Example:-

Bank App Version-1  ----------------------         Client
-Personal Banking     Backward Compatibility        Bank Application
-NRI Banking          Side by side Execution         

BAnk App Version-2
-Credit Cards


Aggregration:
- It is the process of accessing members of one class in another without configuring any relationship between classes.
- It is reffered as "Object-to-Object" communication.
- It often called as "Has-A-Relation".
- It is possible by configuring an object for existing class in new class.
- It avoids data hiding and overriding.
