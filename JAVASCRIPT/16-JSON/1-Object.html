JavaScript Object Type :-

- “Alan Kay” introduced the concept of object into computer programming in early 1960’s.
- The intention of object is to keep all related data and logic together.
-  JavaScript object comprises of data and logic configured under the reference of “Keys”
-  Hence in JavaScript object is a key-value collection.

Syntax:
            {
              “Key” : value
            }

- Key is string type and value can be any type [Primitive, Non-Primitive]
- Multiple keys and values are separated with “,” delimeter.

CSS Object
            {
             display: “none”;
             color:white;
            }

JavaScript Object

            {
              “Name”: “TV”,
              “Price”: 45000.44
            }

- Logic for object is defined by using “function”.

            {
             “Price”: 45000.44,
            “Qty” : 2,
            “Total”: function() { },
            “Print” : function() { }
            }

CSS Object
            {
              display: “block”;
              background-color: rgb();
            }

- Object enables
   
        a) Reusability
        b) Separation
        c) Extensibility

- If object comprises of data only and it just represents data without function, then it is reffered as “JSON” type. [JavaScript Object Notation]

- In a network data is transfered in Binary format, which can be blocked by firewalls.
- All applications need data in a format, which is understandable to every OS & Device.
- Modern software technologies transport data in 2 formats
       
        a) XML        [Extensible Markup Language]
        b) JSON        [JavaScript Object Notation]

- XML and JSON are the formats for data, which can reach any device and any OS service. And understandable to any browser.

Syntax:

    var  weather = {
            “City”: “Hyderabad”,
            “Day”: 28,
            “Night”: 19
            }

     weather.City                    => returns  “Hyderabad”
     weather.City= “Delhi”            => assigns Delhi by replacing Hyderabad
