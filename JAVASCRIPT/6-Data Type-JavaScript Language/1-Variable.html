<!-- Variable in JavaScript -->
<!-- Variable:- Variable are Storage locations in memory Where You can Store a value
and use it as a part of any expression.
Variable Configuration comprises in 3 phases

var price;
let price;
const price; [Const will not allow only declaraton.]

(b)Assignment:- Assignment is the process of Storing Value into reference 
Variable after declaration.
var price; => declaring
price = 3000.44; => assigning

(c)Initialization:- Initialization is the process of configuring a value into
Variable at the time of declaring.
var price = 30000.44; => Initialization
