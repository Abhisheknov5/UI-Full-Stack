<!-- What is difference between var let and const -->
<!--
Var:- It is used to configure a function scope Variable.
-> You can declare in any block of a function and access from any another block in
function.
-> Var allows declaring, assignment and initialization.
-->
<script> 
    function demo()
    {
        var x; // declaring a variable.
        x = 10; // Assigning a value into variable.
        if(x==10) // Compare right value equal to left value. 
        {         // If the right value is equal to left value then it will return true.
            var y=20; // Initialization
        }
        document.write("x=" + x + "<br>" + "y=" +y);
    }
    demo(); // call the function
</script> 

<!--Actually It have 2 block first is Function Block another is if block
 There are two concept Inner block and Outer block and var y = "20"; is Inner block.
Now var y= "20"; is initialized with value It is present in if block and I am trying to access 
y Outside the Block.

->It allows Shadowing
