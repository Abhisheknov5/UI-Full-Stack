<!--
FAQ's:
1. Can we define a switch without default?
A. Yes.

2. Can we define default before or between cases?
A. Yes.

3. Can we define a case without break?
A. Yes. It executes all blocks until the next jump statement occurs. (or) It terminates
     after the end of switch block.

4. Can we define "return" as jump statement?
A. Yes. But return requires the code kept in a function.

5. What is difference between break and return?
A. "break" is a jump statement that exits the current block but stays in the function.
    "return" is a jump statement that terminates the block and the further compiliation.

Note: "return" can be used only inside a function. Hence the code block must be in function.
