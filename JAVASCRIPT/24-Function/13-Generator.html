Function Generator:-

- A function generator is used as backend for an iterator function in JavaScript.
- It is used to configure iterators, that can access elements from a collection in seqential order.
- Iterator doesn't require an initialization, condition and counter, because it is designed with a generator that provides built in initialization, condition and counter.

Syntax:
        function*  Name()
        {
        }
   
        "*" is a meta character used to configure zero or more occurances.

- Generator uses "yield" statement that evaluates and returns a value.
- "yield" specifies that the return value is not the last value everytime.
- It uses "next()" method to move to next value in sequence.
- It uses "value" to read and return the value present in collection.
- It uses "done()" to check the status of values in collection, done() method returns true if there are no more values to read.

        var ref = Name();
        ref.next().value
        ref.next().done
