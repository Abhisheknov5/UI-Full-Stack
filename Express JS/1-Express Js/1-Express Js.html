Express JS
- It is a middleware framework used in network based applications to handle communication between the computers [devices] connected over network.

- Distributed Computing is an architecture that allows two different apps running on two different machines to share information.
                            (or)
  Two different applications running in two different process of same machine to share
  information.

- There are various distributed computing technologies
       
        CORBA
        DCOM
        RMI
        EJB
        Web Service
        Remoting
        etc..

- Web Service is known to all technologies, which is a popular distributed computing technology. [Java, .NET, PHP, Python,etc..]

- There are 3 specifications used by Web Service to handle communication

    a) SOAP
    b) REST
    c) JSON

SOAP
- Service Oriented Architecture Protocol
- Service consumer [client] makes an XML request.
- Server provider [server] sends an XML response.

        <Products>                    <Products>
           <Product>                       <Product>    
            <Id> 2 </Id>        =>    <=        <Id>2</Id>
           </Product>                        <Name>TV</Name>
        </Products>                        <Price>30000.33</Price>
                                      </Product>
                                    </Product>
       

REST
- Representational State Transfer
- Consumer will make a query request
- Provider will send an XML response optionally JSON.
- RESTfull services

        https://fakestoreapi.com/products?id=2      =>   XML, JSON


JSON
- JavaScript Object Notation
- Consumer will make JSON request
- Provider will send JSON response

        {                    {
         "Id":1        =>    <=     "Id":1,
        }                    "Name":"TV",
                            }

- Express JS is a framework that provides various libraries to build server side application and configure RESTfull API service.
- A framework can build application and control its flow.
- API is Application Programming Interface.
- Its aim to reach any device and any OS service.
  [any time, any place, any device]
- Express JS is used for
        Web Application
        API
        Performance
- It is used to build and control Multi-tier application.
- It allows design in multi-layer environment.
