API with Express JS :-
Distributed Computing
- What is distributed architecture?
- Various distributed technologies.
- Web Service
- Web Service Specification
    a) SOAP
    b) REST
    c) JSON
- Express JS Middleware

FAQ: What is issue with Web Service?
Ans:
    - It supports only Http protocol
    - It uses SOAP to communicate
    - It is good only for device that can handle XML.
    - It depends on WSDL, UDDI like interfaces.

FAQ: What is API?
Ans:
    - It is Application Programming Interface
    - It can configure a business layer in any backend language
    - It uses REST & JSON.
    - It can work on various protocols.
    - It is secured and cross platform.
    - It can reach various devices.

Creating API using Node & Express JS:

1. Install Express JS in your project

    > npm  i  express --save

2. Create a server side app using express and node

    var express = require("express");

    var app = express();

3. The server side app must be configured with Routes
    - Routing is a technique used to configure SEO and user friendly URL's.
    - User friendly URL's allow to query any content from application with simple
      query request.
    - SEO friendly URL's allow the search engines to idently the content that user is
      browsing and give the suitable suggestions.
    - Modern web applications are using routing both
        a) Server Side
        b) Client Side
    - Server side routing is used for API's.
    - Client side routing is used for client side navigation.
    - API uses routing for managing the request and response.
    - Route requests include

            GET            - to fetch data
            POST        - to submit data
            PUT            - to modify data
            PATCH        - to modify partial data
            DELETE        - to remove data

     - Routes are configured by using following methods

            app.get('path', function(request, response){

            })
            app.post()
            app.put()
            app.patch()
            app.delete()

    - Route paths are defined by using meta characters and reference names.

            /        It refers to default path to render when user is not requesting
                    specific.

            **        It refers to path to render when requested resource is not
                    available [not-found]

    - Every route path have 2 objects
           
            a) Request
            b) Response

4. Server app configures a route table, which is a virtual table to manage requests.
    You have to start server in order to manage request & response.

        app.listen(portNumber);

5. Start the server

        >node app.js

Route Paths:
   
        /        default
        *        not found
        c*        custom route using meta chars
                [you can use any regular expression types]
        c??        starts with "c" and max can be 3 chars.
        c*t        starts with "c" and ends with "t"


Route Parameters:
- Route path can be defined with parameters.
- A parameter allows to query specific content from a request.
- Route parameters are defined using following syntax:

        "/name/:param1/:param2

Syntax:
     app.get("/products")            => without parameter
     app.get("/products/:id")            => with "id" as parameter
     app.get("/products/:id/:price")    => can have multiple parameters

- Parameter values are passed from URL

        /products/2
        /products/2/40000

- You can access the route parameters using "request" object

        request.param    s    =>    { id:2, price:40000}
        request.params.id
        request.params.price
